# OSMC 2024 OpenTelemetry Workshop

This repository contains the slides and labs for the
[OSMC](https://osmc.de/) 2024 OpenTelemetry Workshop.

## Contents

OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral open source Observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. Since its conception it has quickly been adopted by industry leaders in the observability space.

In this workshop, we will take a closer look at the core concepts and the ecosystem, as well as some hands-on demonstrations.

In small sessions we will go from theory to practice, slowly building a working system instrumented with OpenTelemetry.

## Requirements

 Participants need only basic knowledge of Linux and very rudimentary programming skills.
