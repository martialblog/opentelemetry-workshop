# Profiling

The OTel project is working on a new signal: Profiles.

Profiling is a method to dynamically inspect the behavior and performance of application code at run-time.

Tracing focuses on the macro level (request flow).

Profiling focuses on the micro level such as: CPU usage, memory consumption and execution time hot spots.
